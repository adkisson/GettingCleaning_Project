GettingCleaning_Project
=======================

Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

In this repository, you will find:

1. CodeBook.md - information about the datasets
2. README.md - this README file
3. run_analysis.R - the R code to transform the data from the original to the tidy set proscribed by the course project


How to use the run_analysis.R file:

1. download the script file
2. download the data per the course project guidelines
3. unzip the data
4. open Rconsole and change the working directory to the data source
5. run the script -- you must have the dplyr package on your system
6. the tidy data set required for the course project will be in the file "summarized_data.txt" in the
working directory.
